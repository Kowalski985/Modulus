During the first half of the semester, students will conduct a brand audit and develop and administer a survey to determine target audience media usage. The information from the brand audit and market survey will then be used to compile a strategic media plan. Strategies and recommendations will form the basis of the media plan.  \n \nThe course will be taught in an active learning fashion. It strives for a balanced coverage of theoretical and practical issues, industry norms and ideals, and facts and thoughts. The ultimate goal is for students to form their own perspectives, sharpen their strategic thinking, and advance their planning skills. To this end, students should become critical thinkers who move beyond a view of learning as information gathering to a view of learning as knowledge building. All students are expected to be active and proactive in course activities.\n\n",

It strives for a balanced coverage of theoretical and practical issues, industry norms and ideals, and facts and thoughts. The ultimate goal is for students to form their own perspectives, sharpen their strategic thinking, and advance their planning skills. To this end, students should become critical thinkers who move beyond a view of learning as information gathering to a view of learning as knowledge building. All students are expected to be active and proactive in course activities.\n\n",

During the first half of the semester, students will conduct a brand audit and develop and administer a survey to determine target audience media usage. The information from the brand audit and market survey will then be used to compile a strategic media plan. Strategies and recommendations will form the basis of the media plan.  \n \nThe course will be taught in an active learning fashion. It strives for a balanced coverage of theoretical and practical issues, industry norms and ideals, and facts and thoughts. The ultimate goal is for students to form their own perspectives, sharpen their strategic thinking, and advance their planning skills. To this end, students should become critical thinkers who move beyond a view of learning as information gathering to a view of learning as knowledge building. All students are expected to be active and proactive in course activities.\n\n",

During the first half of the semester, students will conduct a brand audit and develop and administer a survey to determine target audience media usage. The information from the brand audit and market survey will then be used to compile a strategic media plan. Strategies and recommendations will form the basis of the media plan.  \n \nThe course will be taught in an active learning fashion. It strives for a balanced coverage of theoretical and practical issues, industry norms and ideals, and facts and thoughts. The ultimate goal is for students to form their own perspectives, sharpen their strategic thinking, and advance their planning skills. To this end, students should become critical thinkers who move beyond a view of learning as information gathering to a view of learning as knowledge building. All students are expected to be active and proactive in course activities.\n\n",

The information from the brand audit and market survey will then be used to compile a strategic media plan. Strategies and recommendations will form the basis of the media plan.  \n \nThe course will be taught in an active learning fashion. It strives for a balanced coverage of theoretical and practical issues, industry norms and ideals, and facts and thoughts. The ultimate goal is for students to form their own perspectives, sharpen their strategic thinking, and advance their planning skills. To this end, students should become critical thinkers who move beyond a view of learning as information gathering to a view of learning as knowledge building.
